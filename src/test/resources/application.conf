#
# This configuration specifies execution profiles for the acceptance and end-to-end test suites.
# If you need/want to change values for running on your local machine, the easiest thing is simply to copy an existing
# profile wholesale and change any properties you need to. Some properties are optional but we don't currently do
# anything fancy like scoping and merging. This can make for duplication, but it is the simplest and clearest way.
